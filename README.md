Usage
-----

(See `tutum/apache-php` for more information.)

Start your image binding the external ports 80 in all interfaces to your
container:

    docker run -d -p 80:80 davidgaya/apache-php-oci

Test your deployment:

    curl http://localhost/

Loading your custom PHP application
-----------------------------------

In order to replace the "phpinfo" application that comes bundled
with this docker image,
create a new `Dockerfile` in an empty folder with the following
contents:

    FROM davidgaya/apache-php-oci:latest
    RUN rm -fr /app && git clone https://github.com/username/customapp.git /app

replacing `https://github.com/username/customapp.git` with your
application's GIT repository.
After that, build the new `Dockerfile`:

    docker build -t username/my-php-app .

And test it:

    docker run -d -p 80:80 username/my-php-app

Test your deployment:

    curl http://localhost/

That's it!
